# TopNetProtocol

## What is the TopNet Protocol?

The Top is a my own network protocol written in C, focused on simple and small data transfers and chatting. It's still a prototype and not ready to be used officially, I'm constantly releasing new updates for this repository and soon it will be really usable for many applications. For now, you can just do some tests with this project.
